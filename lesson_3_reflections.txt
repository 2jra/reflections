When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's better to have a backup of all the updates that you have made so far.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because if it does it automatically it might change something that i did that it didn't need it to changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: it clones a proyect on the github.
	Clones: it clones a proyect on your local pc and on github.
	Branches: it makes a personal version of the proyect by another user locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If something goes wrong you can go back to the copy that was working fine.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Don't know how to answer this one, it would be harder without github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you see that a change from another branch can improved the project then you can merge it.
