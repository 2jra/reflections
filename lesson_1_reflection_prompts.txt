How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because one is diferent than the other

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you mess up a code, you can always go back to a starting point where it was working.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: your are the master of your own destiny because you can choose when to save it.
	Cons: You have to keep track of when you last saved a file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there are some docs that needs to be worked separately and then combined and others that doesn't need to be combined.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I just copy the id of a commit and then i can compare it with another one so i can view the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If i break damage a code i can go back to another version of it where it worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Work on a project with diferent co-workers.
